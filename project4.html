        <p>Final project of the course where I developed a PHP/JavaScript/Java web app simulating a software development company.
            The program includes a login screen, CRUD operations for registering clients and employees in the system, order management, payroll generation, and printing of paychecks in PDF format.
            A Java Spring website was also developed for issuing orders, contacts, and development proposals.
            The PHP application was divided into Development, HR, and Cyber-Security departments, where each order was redirected to the respective employees. <br><br>
            
            What I learned or improved:<br>
            1 - Teamwork<br>
            2 - Web Development<br>
            4 - Java Spring Integration<br><br>

        <p>Development of a PHP/JavaScript web app for a IT store using MySQL database.
            Features include CRUD operations for clients, technicians, materials, catalog, services, and production.
            The program also features a Dashboard that reacts to status changes, administrator permissions, serial number generator, and hour calculation.
            Design was stylized using CSS, aiming for optimized access to functionalities. <br><br>
            
            What I learned or improved:<br>
            1 - Building a database from scratch based on an Entity-Relationship diagram.<br>
            2 - Defining all FK relationships optimizing the use of SQL queries.<br>
            3 - Web Design with CSS, responsive divs, and respect for UX.<br>
            4 - Integrating JavaScript with PHP (It's truly a perfect synergy).<br>
            5 - Using GET and POST methods to move data across pages.<br>
            6 - Working with databases in PHP backend.<br>
            7 - CRUD methods implementation<br>
            8 - OOP PHP<br>
            9 - Mysql Server<br><br>
